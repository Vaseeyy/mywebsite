          The aim of this website is to inform those visiting about myself, and anything pertaining to me personally.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am a 26-year-old male who lives in the United Kingdom. The reason I have created this website is due to the fact that I am currently enrolled in a Software Development course through <a href="https://www.correlation-one.com/"><b>Correlation One</b></a> and as part of this course we are to create our own "Landing Page".

            <h2><u>About me</u></h2>
              <p>As mentioned above, I am a 26-year-old male who lives in the UK, more specifically the North-East of england, who is studying to become a Software Developer. I hope to be able to enter the Software Development field after having completed this course, as I enjoy working with computers and feel like I can be quite successful in this career.

            <h2><u>My Coding journey so far!</u></h2>
            <p>
              I am thoroughly enjoying the course so far, there is a lot of information to take in but thankfully there are plenty of resources available for us to use that will help us out!
            </p>
            <p>
              So far, we have learned how to embed images and links into our webpages, how to change the background colour and text on our pages, how to creat tables and forms, and a bunch of other interesting things! The part I have found most interesting so far is implementing image maps to be able to embed links into images, which I have used to link my facebook below!
            </p>
            <p>
              One of my friends is also currently learning how to code, unfortunately he is not learning through Correlation One like I am. This does, however, allow us to reference eachother's notes and see if there is any difference between how we are both learning, and help eachother out if either of us are struggling with anything in particular.
